# TotalImage
**TotalImage** is a free and open source disk image editor licensed under the MIT license. For more information, see the `LICENSE` file. It is written in C# and uses Windows Forms for the UI.

## Current status

### Downloads
Currently the project is still in early stages of development (alpha-level), and as such is not quite ready for everyday use yet. We will provide official builds once we reach that stage, in the mean time you can build it yourself or ask us to provide binaries for you (see the *Development* and *Support* sections below).

### System requirements
* [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) Desktop Runtime
* Windows 7 SP1/8.1/10/11

Support for other operating systems will be considered within the limitations of .NET.

## Development
To develop TotalImage, we recommend you install [Microsoft Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/). This will give you the designer for Windows Forms, which makes it easier to work with the frontend.

Alternatively, you can also just build the solution with [.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/), which is included in the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).
